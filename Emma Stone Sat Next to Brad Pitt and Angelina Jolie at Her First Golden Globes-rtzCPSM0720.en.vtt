00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.802
-My first guest
is an Oscar-winning actress,

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.238
who stars in the new animated
movie "The Croods: A New Age,"

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.006
which is in theaters
this Wednesday.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.742
Here is our pal, Emma Stone.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.245
Oh, Emma, it is so --
-Hello!

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.015
-Oh, you look fantastic.
It's so good to see your face.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.185
Thank you for being on the show.
-Great to see your face.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.253
Thank you for having me.
This is so weird.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.489
I'm used to kind of, like,
dancing on with you.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.291
-I know, right?
Having an entrance theme.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.327
Well, next -- next time.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.428
Next time, we'll be in person.
-Next time, yes.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.130
-I know, I know.
-This is the right --

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.365
-This is the right decision
for now.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.267
-Thank you. Yeah.
Good, good, good.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.268
I want to get into --
There's a ton of stuff

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.071
I want to talk to you about,
but I wanted to ask you

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.140
what you've been up to
during quarantine,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.842
and I was told by our producers
to ask you this,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.112
because a lot of people
are revisiting old hobbies,

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.248
and then they said
that you made me something

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.784
'cause you got into
making bracelets?

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.819
-I got into making bracelets,
yes.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.756
I mean, I've been doing the kind
of, like, typical, you know,

00:00:56.756 --> 00:01:00.727
Zoom meetings,
sleeping more than usual,

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.695
eating more than usual
kind of thing,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.464
but then I got into making,
you know, like,

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.733
stretchy string
and beaded bracelets.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.001
-Now, I have it here.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.104
-And so I had to send one
over to you.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.939
-Now, did you sign this?
-Yeah.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.075
[ Laughs ]
-I love that.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.244
-Okay.
I'm glad you like it.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.380
-Can we see? I don't even know
if I can zoom in, but...

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.049
-Can you see?

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.184
It just says,
"Bracelet for Jimmy."

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.253
-"Bracelet for Jimmy."
[ Laughs ]

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.688
It's so good.
-Yeah.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.089
-I'm wearing it.
-Just "Jimmy" felt boring,

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.924
so that's the bracelet
that's for you.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.125
-Look at this guy.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.094
-You can always wear
your Bracelet for Jimmy.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.630
-Look at that.
Bracelet for Jimmy.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.665
-It's so stupid.
-It's so good.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.202
It's cutting off my circulation,
so I have a dead hand now.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.203
-Okay, good.
That was the intention.

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.339
If you need to get your blood
drawn or anything at any point,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.508
you can use it as a tourniquet.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.543
-I might, actually.
You never know.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.046
In quarantine, have you got
hooked on any new shows?

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.647
What have you been doing?
What have you been watching?

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:58.351
Tell me.
-I watched a lot of shows.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.619
I hear that "The Queen's Gambit"
is very good,

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.121
and I have not watched that yet,
but --

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.390
-Me neither.
I tried a little bit.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.092
-You did?
What happened?

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.461
-Well, I thought it was going to
be about royals or something.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.063
That type of queen.
-It's about chess.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:12.231
-Yeah.
-Right?

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.499
-Yeah.
-Oh.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.901
Somebody doesn't like chess.

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.070
-It's not that
I don't like chess.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.005
I just don't know if it's
my go-to thing to watch.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.874
It's not your -- you're not,
like, searching for hobbies.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:25.077
-I can watch anything.
Chess isn't on the list.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.280
It's not an any --
-You're not gonna choose chess.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.714
I hear you.
I understand.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.751
-I pay, you know,
$20 a month for Netflix.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.053
You know, there's things
I want to see, but chess --

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.855
-You want some bang
for your buck.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.390
I hear what you're saying.
-That's what I'm talking about.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.726
But I'm clearly wrong,
'cause everyone loves it.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.826
And so I'll get into it
eventually.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.461
-I know.
Everybody does love it.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.829
I'm actually very excited
to watch it.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.465
But I've been watching
a bunch of different stuff.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.268
I watched all of --
My favorite show "Search Party,"

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.636
which is --
not everybody knows this show.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.505
It's amazing.
I watched all of it in one day,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.307
accidentally,
when it came out in June,

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.776
and then I was like, "I wish
I had stretched it out more."

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.812
But now I just discovered

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.780
"The Real Housewives
of Salt Lake City."

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.948
That's new.
Have you seen it yet?

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:05.151
-No, I have not seen that.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.787
-Oh, boy,
do you need to watch it.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.189
Oh, yeah.
-Salt Lake City?

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.957
-Salt Lake City.
-See, this is why I ask.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.759
Only two episodes are out
so far.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.195
I don't really watch
a lot of reality TV, actually.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.329
I haven't really watched

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.699
too many
"Real Housewives" franchises.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.868
-Oh.
-But Salt Lake City

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.872
is incredible, because you add
the Mormon element to it,

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.842
and it's just --
Like, there's the typical

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.811
kind of, like, judgment
of each other and fights,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.446
but when you throw God
in the mix, and you're like,

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.282
"That's not
what he would want"...

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.883
-Wow.
-...it really takes it

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.052
to another level.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.953
Also, some of them drink,
some of them don't.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.088
-Of course.
-Because of Mormonism.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:45.792
And then they're skiing all
the time and there's a lot of --

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.361
-So there's ski bunnies.
-There's ski bunnies.

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:51.397
I really think
you're gonna be into it.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.799
-I will love it.
-The drama is extreme.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.668
There's a woman that,
they're in a huge fight

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:59.972
because she told her that
she smelled like a hospital.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.674
And that
is the root of their fight.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.876
-[ Laughs ]
-Can you imagine?

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.412
-That's a good dis, though.
-Yeah.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.147
-Ooh.
-Really, really good dis.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.515
-Wow!
Got under her skin.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.083
That really bothered her.
-She had been at the hospital.

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.719
-That really got to her.
-I mean, come on.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.019
-That got to her.
-It really got to her.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.354
Yes, it's bad.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:17.456
-I watched a little bit
of "Unforgiving."

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.693
The first two --
Is it "Unforgiving?"

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.195
On HBO, with Nicole Kidman?
-The Clint Eastwood movie?

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.164
No.
Yeah, "The Unforgiven."

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.299
It's now a sitcom.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.033
-Oh, so a little bit
of "Unforgiven."

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.569
-[ Laughs ]
-Of what -- which one is it?

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.804
-Is it "Unforgi--"
There's no one here to ask.

00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:35.708
The Nicole Kidman,
Hugh Grant show.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.643
-Oh! Oh!
-"Unfollowing"?

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.112
-"The Undoing."
-Yes.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:42.314
-Is that what it's called?
-It's "The Undoing."

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:44.884
-"The Undoing."
Because maybe he did something

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.919
he shouldn't have been doing.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.355
-Yeah, and that's not very cool.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.157
But let's watch
and see what happens.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:54.127
-Or did he not do something?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.362
Who's doing
that needs to be undid?

00:04:57.362 --> 00:04:58.964
-What needs to be undone?

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.067
-Oh, this one -- "Undone" --
I would've liked that.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.468
That's a good title.
-Is it called "The Undone"?

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:06.338
-It should be.
But it's great.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:07.673
-Oh, is it?
Okay. All right.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.007
I need to watch that.
I love Nicole Kidman.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.943
-Dude, she's hitting homers.
She's fantastic.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.880
-Oh, she's just like a --
-It's almost --

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.048
-That was like when we used
to watch "Downton Abby,"

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.718
and you would just watch --
It was Maggie Smith, right?

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.921
Going, like, hitting it right
out of the park, every line,

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.823
just soaring over the --
-Every -- This one --

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:26.125
-Unbelievable.
-Wait till you see this.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.794
You won't even believe.
You'll be like, "Oh, yeah.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.595
Nicole Kidman
just stole the show."

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.263
-She's already ridiculous.
-Yeah. It's totally ridiculous.

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.999
I'm like, "Oh."
She's coming on soon.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.333
I want
to talk to her about that.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.002
'Cause it's almost like,
when you see it you'll be like,

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.505
"Oh, my God.
That's a movie star."

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.742
-What are any of us
doing this for?

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:43.976
-Why are we doing this?

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.978
-When she's out there
doing that.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.580
-Oh, stop it.
You are you.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.914
I mean, I can go through my list
of my favorite --

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:52.384
-Jimmy, do you think I'm good?
[ Both laugh ]

00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:55.855
-"Am I pretty -- Am I pretty --
Am I a pretty girl?"

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.291
-"Don't you think -- I --
-[ Laughing ]

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:01.593
Smoking.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:02.895
Dude, you know
what was on the other day?

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.064
-"It's been a long time."
What?

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.933
"Easy A" was on the other day,
and I was like --

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:10.169
That's probably been almost
probably 10 years, I think,

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.171
since I first probably met you,
and that movie was fantastic.

00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:16.375
-10 years. Well, I met you
before "Easy A," didn't I?

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.910
Was that the first time
I ever met you?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.879
-No.
Maybe right before.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.347
-Yeah. But I --
Yes.

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:24.550
It's been 10 years,
which is so surreal.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.386
And it also is --
Oh, this was another thing

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.620
I was talking
to your producers about.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.690
I was like,
"Oh, when 'Easy A' came out,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.925
right around the same time
is when I got my tattoo,"

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.527
and then I got into -- my whole
family has this tattoo,

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:38.597
and I told them what's
been happening with it,

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:41.733
which is that it's supposed
to be the size of a pencil,

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.669
like pencil-thin drawing,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.104
and this is what's
been happening to it

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.505
over the past 10 years.
-It's growing?

00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:49.175
-This is my marker of time.
-What are they?

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.577
Are they chicken hands?
Chicken feet?

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:54.012
-They're blackbird feet.

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.582
And everyone in my family
has them, and theirs look like

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.451
they're fading away,
they're so thin.

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:03.455
And mine has just bled out,
and by the time I'm 80,

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:05.257
I'm gonna have a black bar
against my wrist.

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:08.794
It is so ridiculous
how bad this is getting.

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:10.095
[ Laughter ]

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.731
-What are you gonna do?
-Like the rings on a tree.

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:16.001
I now know that it's
been 10 years since "Easy A."

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.604
-You got your Golden Globe
nomination for "Easy A."

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.473
What do you remember from that
experience going to the Globes?

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.442
Who'd you go with?
-I went with my mom.

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:25.244
That was my first time
going to the Golden Globes.

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.613
It was very, very,
very exciting,

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.481
and so I took my mom with me.

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.150
And I feel like I've already
told this story before,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.452
but we sat next to
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:35.988
-[ Gasps ]
-Did I ever tell you this story?

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:38.323
-Never!
-Oh, my God.

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:41.761
We were like, "Of all people
to be sitting next to

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.663
at that kind of a show, whoa."
-Yeah.

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:48.401
-And my mom never drinks, and
she had champagne that night,

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.405
which was, you know,
probably not the best idea,

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.906
but she was having
a wonderful time.

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.474
-I love mom.
-And she started asking

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:58.911
Angelina Jolie, like,
"Do you have kids?

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.779
Do you have kids?
Are you, like --

What do you guys --
So you --"

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.749
And I was like, "You have
got to be out of your --"

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.884
She completely knew,
but she was, like,

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:08.554
making small talk
about the kids.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:11.190
"How old are they?
What are their names?"

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.192
She knew everything.
-Yeah.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.895
-But they were so nice.
They were so nice.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:17.662
-Yeah. She is cool.
-We had a blast.

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:19.531
We had a really good time.
That was a very fun night.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:22.802

-No. No.
-Real fast.

We won't even know we're gone.
-No, I don't want to.
